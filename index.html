      <p> My name is Rachael and I am a person. I live in Seattle and I like coding, even if right in this moment I want to destroy whoever dreamed up CSS.</p>
      <p> I was born in NYC, but only lived there for a few years. My family moved around a lot when I was a little kid for job stuff. After New York, we lived in Washington D.C., before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
      <p> It is hard writing enough to see whether my internal links will work! OK here is the rest of my life story. I went to college in Massachusetts because I wanted an adventure, and I hadn't really been back to the East Coast since I was a little kid. College was pretty neat. My junior year, I studied abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland. I was only supposed to stay for a semester, but I liked it so much I found a way to stay all year. </p>
      <p> After college, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do, so I found a job teaching English as a foreign language in Prague, in the Czech Republic. Prague is a pretty incredible city, and I made a lot of friends from all over the world. I also drank a fair amount of very cheap, very tasty beer.</p>
      <p> While I was in Prague, I decided to take the LSATS and apply to Law School. I got in to the University of Washington, so I came back to the States and moved to Seattle. I had only ever been here once before, on a road trip to the Capitol Hill Block Party when I was about 19 years old. Nevertheless, I was convinced it was some kind of mecca, where the sun always shone and everyone wore flannel and big bushy beards. It rains a lot more than I expected, but I was pretty spot on with the rest, I think. </p>
      <p> I liked law school, but didn't like being a lawyer. A friend turned me on to coding, and here I am. </p>

  <section id="Portfolio">
    <h2> Portfolio </h2>
    <article>
      <p> Someday there will be photos here that link to beautiful webpages I will someday build. They will be pretty cool. </p>
      <p> Yes there will be many many links for different projects and they will fill up enough space to make my last internal link work.</p>
      <p> For now I will just type and type and type and hope for the best. </p>

    <h2> Resume </h2>
    <article>
      <p> Someday I will put my resume here. It will be very accomplished, I'm sure.  It will have lots of different things, like: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Educational History </li>
        <li> Work History </li>
        <li> Personal Interests </li>
